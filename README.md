## Setting up
Depending on your web browser, the set up wil be slightly different. But it should be pretty much the same

Go to your browsers **settings** and set the startup page, home page and [new tab page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna/) to [Q-Search's website](https://abood025.github.io/Auxiliatrium/)

After that, you're all ready!

## Tips:
> You can click a button without searching for anything and it will take you to that website's homepage

> In the Reddit search, you can do r/{subreddit name here} to go to the desired subreddit
